#Quiz III Review Sheet

### Quiz Topics

### Sanger Sequencing
Be able to define and explain the following:

* Sequencing primers
* Dideoxynucleotides
* Steps in sequencing process (melting, annealing, polymerase function)
* Purpose of electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel

See: [Sequencing animation](https://www.dnalc.org/resources/animations/cycseq.html)

### Data Analysis

Be able to explain:

* What is the purpose of trimming DNA sequencing reads (why must you do this?)
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DNA Sequencers usually produce poor quality sequences with missing nucleotides at the start and end of the sequence. Trimming removes misleading data that is incorrect, mostly in the beginning and end of a sequence.
* What the BLAST tool does:
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This tool allows us to search for similar DNA Sequences. It uses an algorithm to search GenBank (large collection of DNA Sequences).
* What is a transition, transversion (mutation types)
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transition: a mutation where a purine and purine or a peremidine and peremidine attach, which involves bases of similar shape. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transversion: a mutation where a peremidine and purine attach, which involves an exchange of one-ring and two-ring structures
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transition mutations are more likely to happen than transversions because substituting a single ring structure for another single ring structure is more common than substituting a double ring for a single ring structure.
