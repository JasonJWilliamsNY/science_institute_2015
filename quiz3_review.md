#Quiz III Review Sheet

### Quiz Topics

### Sanger Sequencing
Be able to define and explain the following:

* Sequencing primers
* Dideoxynucleotides- ddNTP is added to a reaction as a chain-elongating inhibititor of DNA Polymerase. Dideoxynucleotides are missing 2 nucleotides and also have a floursecent dye 
* Steps in sequencing process (melting, annealing, polymerase function)- during the melting stage the DNA is heated up, denatures and the double strands are separtated. Next comes the annealing stage where the reaction is cooled long enough for the PCR Primer to bond to the single strand DNA. During the extension stage, the nucleotides float around randomly and if the correct one hits the polymerase, it gets attached. Instead of dNTP being incorporated a ddNTP will be incorporated but the ddNTP prevents the matching nucleotide from attaching because it doesn't fit, thus causing the chain to terminate. 
* Purpose of electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel- polyacrylamid gel is much thicker and gives us a much higher resolution than agorose gel. The machine separates the strands by size/weight and in polyacrylamide it is very detailed.

### Data Analysis

Be able to explain:

* What is the purpose of trimming DNA sequencing reads (why must you do this?)
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DNA Sequencers usually produce poor quality sequences with missing nucleotides at the start and end of the sequence. Trimming removes misleading data that is incorrect, mostly in the beginning and end of a sequence.
* What the BLAST tool does:
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This tool allows us to search for similar DNA Sequences. It uses an algorithm to search GenBank (large collection of DNA Sequences).
* What is a transition, transversion (mutation types)
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transition: a mutation where a purine and purine or a peremidine and peremidine attach, which involves bases of similar shape. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transversion: a mutation where a peremidine and purine attach, which involves an exchange of one-ring and two-ring structures
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transition mutations are more likely to happen than transversions because substituting a single ring structure for another single ring structure is more common than substituting a double ring for a single ring structure.
