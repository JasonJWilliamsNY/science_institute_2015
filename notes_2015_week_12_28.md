## Determining DNA Size and Concentration

Gel electrophoresis is one of the most basic techniques in the molecular biology laboratory. This week's lab will give us a new skill, refresh some old skills, and introduce the idea of designing a 'scientific' experiment. 

## Homework question - TBE recipe 

How much of the following will we need in order to make 250ml 5X TBE given the following recipe?

|Reagent|F.W. or starting conc.|final conc.|
|-------|--------------------------------|-----------|
|Tris|121.4 g/m|445mM*|
|Boric Acid|61.83|445mM|
|EDTA|0.5 M|10mM|
*milli-Molar

**Hint:** In each case, your final solution volume is 250ml - calculate each reagent independently.
