#January 2016 Semester Take-home final
## Final due date: January 20th 11:59PM

### Description
This should be a 1.5-2 page write up of the DNA Barcoding work we have done so far in class. 

### Requirements
1. You must write your lab report with the following sections
    * Introduction and background (~250 words)
    * Materials and methods 
    * Observations and conclusions
    * Work citied
2. You must submit submit your report via email to williams@yuhsg.org by the due date. 
3. You may write in either Markdown or using a word processing program like MS Word


### Section Descriptions

#### Introduction
Must give a brief introduction to what DNA Barcoding is, and why it is important. **This section must contain a reference/work cited.** You will have to go online to find papers related to DNA barcoding and explaining its use, and perhaps even how the technique was created. 

If you are unsure when to cite a source see: http://biol1114.okstate.edu/study_guides/labs/citation.htm . In short, when you are stating a fact that is not generally known, or paraphrasing someone else's work you must use a citation. 

### Materials and Methods
This section should be a detailed step-by-step description of the DNA extraction portion of the DNA Barcoding experiment. Also detail any/all information about your plant sample (Where it was collected, and description on what you think it may be before you did the experiment). Number all steps using notes from your lab notebook as a guide. 

### Observations and conclusions
We are not ready to make very strong conclusions in this first attempt at a lab writeup. Still we can describe what data we collect so far. Answer the following questions in this section. 

1. During the DNA extraction what did you observe about your sample (Color changes, viscosity changes, DNA pellet, etc.)?
2. According to the electrophoresis gel, did your PCR work (did you get a band)?
3. When you viewed your sample in DNA Subway did you get a 'Low Quality Score Alert'?
4. When you used DNA Subway's BLAST tool, what species matched? **In a table** Give the names of the top 3 matches and indicate how many mismatches (if any) there were between your sample and the retrieved matches. 


Finally, give your opinion on whether you think you have identified the species of your sample and your reasons for trusting or doubting that tentative conclusion. 

### Works cited
List any cited works. 


## Resources

The following resources will help you complete this report. 

1. [Barcoding 101 protocol](http://www.dnabarcoding101.org/protocol_collecting_specimens.html) - remember that we did not follow exactly this protocol. Use it as a guide but do not plagiarize. Especially use the section on DNA subway to help you answer questions
2. [DNA Subway](http://dnasubway.iplantcollaborative.org/) - Use this (log in as guest) to answer the last set of questions. You will find our DNA sample under tracking number 10-316153237 (use the search feature). All the instructions you need should be in the DNA Barcoding protocol. I will help with questions on using Subway. 
3. An online tool that help you properly format your works cited is: https://www.citethisforme.com/ If using this, please search for the citation style (Bioinformatics) on the menu bar on top of the page (Item 2). 

I estimate that this work will take about 2 hours. If you are spending longer then it is possible you are being too detailed.
