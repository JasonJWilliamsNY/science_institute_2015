#DNA Barcoding
#### Week of : October 26, 2015

### Important terms

* DNA
* Gene
* DNA Barcode
* DNA Extraction
* Genome
* PCR
* Sampling
* Metadata


### Important Concepts
* DNA is information
* Metadata makes Data valuable
* Biochemistry allows to examine the cell
* Science is limited (it can only tell us so much)


## Introduction to DNA Barcoding

Over the next several sessions, we will be introducing DNA Barcoding as our prototypical laboratory. By going in-depth we will learn a lot about scientific process as it pertains to working in a molecular biology laboratory. 

DNA Barcoding (See the [Laboratory Manual](https://github.com/JasonJWilliamsNY/science_institute_2015/tree/master/pdfs/using-dna-barcodes.pdf))allows us to get a tentative identification of a sample (tissue, food, etc.) based on a unique DNA-Sequence. There are millions or billions of nucleotides in the genome of a eukaryotic organism. Finding the correct sequence for a barcode is not trivial (See: [DNA Barcode for Land Plants](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/31/12794.full)). In this lab we will begin to understand how to:

* Get DNA from a sample (for example a leaf)
* Localize and copy a specific section of DNA (PCR)
* Read and analyze DNA sequence

PIPETTE DEMO 
What is a Pipette?
  easy way to transfer liquid
Adjustable pipettes:
  Works with microliter volumes.
  Reusable without cross contamination.
      use disposable plastic tips
  Highly accurate and precise.
  Comes in three colors:
      Blue-   100-1000
      Yellow- 10-100
      Grey-   0.5-10
    Always use the pipette with the smallest range!
  Remember to match tubes with the correct pipette.
      blue- blue tips
      yellow- 200 tips
      grey- 10 tips
  Remember to pipette from the first stop.


This laboratory will take several sessions, and we will focus a great deal on good laboratory technique and process (including documentation of metadata)
