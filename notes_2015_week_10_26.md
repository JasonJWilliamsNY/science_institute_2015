### Important terms

* DNA
* Gene
* DNA Barcode
* DNA Extraction
* Genome
* PCR
* Sampling
* Metadata


### Important Concepts
* DNA is information
* Metadata makes Data valuable
* Biochemistry allows to examine the cell
* Science is limited (it can only tell us so much)


## Introduction to DNA Barcoding

Over the next several sessions, we will be introducing DNA Barcoding as our prototypical laboratory. By going in-depth we will learn a lot about scientific process as it pertains to working in a molecular biology laboratory. 

DNA Barcoding (See the [Laboratory Manual](https://github.com/JasonJWilliamsNY/science_institute_2015/tree/master/pdfs/using-dna-barcodes.pdf))allows us to get a tentative identification of a sample (tissue, food, etc.) based on a unique DNA-Sequence. There are millions or billions of nucleotides in the genome of a eukaryotic organism. Finding the correct sequence for a barcode is not trivial (See: [DNA Barcode for Land Plants](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/31/12794.full)). In this lab we will begin to understand how to:

* Get DNA from a sample
* Localize and copy a specific section of DNA
* Read and analyze DNA sequence


This laboratory will take several sessions, and we will focus a great deal on good laboratory technique and process (including documentation of metadata)
