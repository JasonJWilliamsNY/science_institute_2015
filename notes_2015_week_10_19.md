## Calculating moles

Check out this helpful explanation to review the concept of moles we discussed in class last week. [YouTube - The Mole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pft2CASl0M0). To calculate how many moles we have we only need to know one thing, the mass (for atoms - the atomic mass, for molecules - the formula wight). Looking at a [periodic table](http://www.ptable.com/) we see that carbon has an atomic mass ~12. This means when we have 12g of carbon we have ~ 6.02 X10^23 atoms of carbon. 

**Formula - grams to moles**
moles = grams of substance/ molecular (or atomic) mass


#### How confident are you about answering the following questions

* How many moles do I have if I have 24g of carbon?
* How many moles do I have if I have 6g of carbon?
* How many moles in 18g of H<sub>2</sub>0?
* How many moles in 25g of H<sub>2</sub>0?


## Calculating concentration

The standard unit of concentration in chemistry is [molarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration). 

**Formula - concentration**
molarity = moles of substance / volume (liters) of solvent

A 1 Molar solution is defined as 1 mole of solute in 1 liter of water. 

#### How confident are you about answering the following questions

* What is the concentration of 58.44g of NaCl in 1L of H<sub>2</sub>0?
* What is the concentration of 58.44g of NaCl in 0.5L of H<sub>2</sub>0?
* How many grams of NaCl would you need to make a 5M (5 molar) solution if you had 0.5L of H<sub>2</sub>0?


## Calculating dilutions

We typically will keep concentrated solutions of the chemicals we need in the lab and then dilute them down to a <u>working concentration</u>.  

**Formula - dilution**
Original Concentration * Original Volume = Final Concentration * Final Volume 
or
C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>

Example problem:

If we have 5M NaCl and we want 0.5L of 1M NaCl

C<sub>1</sub> = 5M
V<sub>1</sub> = X (unknown)
C<sub>2</sub> = 1M
V<sub>2</sub> = 0.5L

To solve, 

5 M * X L = 1M * 0.5L
5 M * X L = 0.5 (M*L) # 0.5 Mole Liters
X L = 0.5 (M*L) / 5 M 
X L  = 0.1L # Mole units cancel when we divide
X = 0.1 L

So we need to add 0.1L of 5M NaCl to 0.5 L of H<sub>2</sub>0 to get a final concentration of 1M NaCl

#### How confident are you about answering the following questions

* How would dilute 5M NaCl to make 1 liter of 0.5M NaCl?
* How would you dilute 10M C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> to make 1 liter of 0.5M C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>?
