## Introduction to PCR

In continuation of the DNA Barcoding lab, this week will introduce an important technique called Polymerase Chain Reaction or [PCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction). The PCR technique will allow us to examine certain regions of DNA (in this case the barcode regions) by selectively amplifying them and then sequencing them (reading the chemical composition of the DNA basepairs). 

# Class Contributions
PCR, Polymerase Chain Reaction allows us to selectively amplify (copy) specific DNA sequences. Chain reactions are usually exponential and while continuing from A to B to C they are also getting larger. DNA is made up of base pairs A,T,C and G. Only certain regions of the sequence have known functions. A gene will have a very specific pattern if it encodes for a protein. Genes are highly conserved, non genes are not conserved. You will need to look at the genes to identify the species of your sample, hoping most of the genes would be conserved with some changes. 
PCR- Polymerase Chain Reaction
•	Polymer- chain of repeating unit. 
•	Chain Reaction- Usually exponential. What does that mean? It continues, but it gets bigger with every time. 
Ex- Extreme dominos multiplying, getting bigger with every step. Or a nuclear chain reaction. 
•	Nuclear reaction are dangerous because it can get big very quickly. One atom splits, and products hits other atoms and gets big fast. 
•	PCR allows us to selectively amplify/copy specific DNA sequences. It’s one of the most powerful/common techniques used. 
•	DNA is always copying into duplicates. 
•	Sequence requires a highly concentrated sample of DNA.  
•	DNA- Deoxyribonucleic acid. 
•	Genomic DNA- any piece of DNA. 
•	But could be specific DNA. 
•	Key concept: IN DNA, (made up of base pairs), only certain regions have known functions. 
•	On a genome, there is DNA. The ret of the stuff is called intergenic regions. 
•	Gene- a segment of DNA that encodes protein. 
•	Non gene- not highly conserved. 
•	A piece of DNA that codes for protein’s is a gene. 
Ex-cxththeredcatthxygmzxlyzn
•	All we see in the DNA are the words, the relevant parts. 
•	There is a difference between genes and non genes. 
•	Genes are highly conversed. 
•	Non genes not conserved. (Not essential to how cells function). 
Thought Question: DNA barcoding lab is to identify species. If we want to ask if species are related, what do we look at? Genes or non genes?
We want to look at genes. Assuming it’s well conserved, with only a few differences. Need to look at a pieces of DNA all species have, so you can make a comparison.
#Notes from DNA Barcoding Lab
•	Cat number- tells us what kit we are using, so if we want to reproduce the experiment, it makes it clear which kit. 
•	Lot number- Which batch the chemicals are made in. If something in the experiment stops working , we can isolate the problem.
•	You grind the plant tissue in a labeled 1.5 ml microfuge tube. 
•	You label on the top, so it is clear who’s tube it is when in the centrifuge. 
•	If you add all 600 μ at once, then the leaf may float and be harder to grind. 
•	Nuclei lysis buffer- Breaks down the cell membrane. 
•	We grind the tissue to help break down the cell wall/cell membrane. 
•	We heat in order to speed u p the process. 
•	RNAse will selectively break down RNA, into individual bases. 
•	Metabolic enzymes will bring stuff together, catabolic will separate stuff. 
•	What is protein precipitation? It pulls protein out of a solution 
•	Triple Point- temperature where all three states of a substance can coexist. 
•	Water is the universal solvent. 
•	Liquid in post centrifuged tube is called supernatant. 
•	Solid is called pellet.

Place a link to an interesting science or news article where PCR was involved to solve a mystery or to do an experiment. 

>Hint: You can add a link to the notes by putting a set of square brackets '[]' next to a set of parentheses (). Put the text of the link in the square brackets [Text] and the website address in the parentheses (someurl). So '\[Text](someurl)'. When your change is saved  to GitHub it will create the link. You can also see examples in the notes earlier.

#DNA Barcoding - PCR
Notes from 11/2-3
DNA barcoding is a way for us to identify species
1. Plants are sampled
2. DNA is extracted
3. Portions of DNA have a "barcode" which is amplified and each barcode is unique
4. DNA is compared with unknown sequences to see if we find a match in the database so we can identify it
Problems- 1. nobody knows how many species there are. We estimate that there are around 6,000 mammals and amphibians, 10,000 birds and reptiles, and 31,000 fish. There are currently between 1.5-2 million species and we estimate that this is only about a half of the existent species
2. there is a debate on how to define a species
Some might genotypically be similar but not phenotypically similar and genders of the same bird look very different. A species can mate and produce fertile offspring, eat same food, have genetic similarities..
biomimetics- we copy nature's designs, tells us about ecosystem/environment
ex- amphibians have thick skin that needs water and if they die out it shows the environment is polluted
3. taxonomy isn't adequate to capture vanishing biodiversity. Traditional barcoding is open to vagueness as opposed to barcoding which is more objective
DNA extraction- we crush a sample of a leaf to get to the nucleus. A cell contains organelles and organic compounds such as lipids such as the cell membrane's phospholipid bilayer, peptides like amino acids, carbohydrates such as cellulose and nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA. We need to chemically get rid of everything other than the DNA in order to extract it.
