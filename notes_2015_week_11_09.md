#DNA Barcoding - PCR
#### Week of : November 9th, 2015

### Important terms

* DNA-Deoxyribonucleic acid, carries genetic information necessary for the developmant, function and reproduction of living organisms.
* Gene
* PCR-Peliminary chain reaction, used to amplify/copy spacific DNA sequences
* PCR Primer
* PCR Machine




### Important Concepts
* PCR allows specific amplification of DNA
* Some regions of DNA contains 'genes'; some do not
* We can sequence DNA



## Introduction to PCR

In continuation of the DNA Barcoding lab, this week will introduce an important technique called Polymerase Chain Reaction or [PCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction). The PCR technique will allow us to examine certain regions of DNA (in this case the barcode regions) by selectively amplifying them and then sequencing them (reading the chemical composition of the DNA basepairs).

### Interesting News Articles

Place a link to an interesting science or news article where PCR was involved to solve a mystery or to do an experiment. 

>Hint: You can add a link to the notes by putting a set of square brackets '[]' next to a set of parentheses (). Put the text of the link in the square brackets [Text] and the website address in the parentheses (someurl). So '\[Text](someurl)'. When your change is saved  to GitHub it will create the link. You can also see examples in the notes earlier.
