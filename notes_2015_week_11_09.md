#DNA Barcoding - PCR
#### Week of : November 9th, 2015

### Important terms

* DNA-Deoxyribonucleic acid, carries genetic information necessary for the developmant, function and reproduction of living organisms.
* Gene
* PCR-Peliminary chain reaction, used to amplify/copy spacific DNA sequences
* PCR Primer
* PCR Machine




### Important Concepts
* PCR allows specific amplification of DNA
* Some regions of DNA contains 'genes'; some do not
* Genes are highly conserved while non-genes are not
* We can sequence DNA



## Introduction to PCR

In continuation of the DNA Barcoding lab, this week will introduce an important technique called Polymerase Chain Reaction or [PCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction). The PCR technique will allow us to examine certain regions of DNA (in this case the barcode regions) by selectively amplifying them and then sequencing them (reading the chemical composition of the DNA basepairs). 

# Class Contributions
PCR, Polymerase Chain Reaction allowes us to selectively amplify (copy) specific DNA sequences. Chain reactions are usually exponential and while continueing from A to B to C they are also getting larger. DNA is made up of base pairs A,T,C and G. Only certain regions of the sequence have known functions. A gene will have a very specific pattern if it incodes for a protein. Genes are highly concerved, non genes are not conserved. You will need to look at the genes to identify the species of yor sample, hoping most of the genes would be conserved with some changes. 
PCR- Polymerase Chain Reaction
•	Polymer- chain of repeating unit. 
•	Chain Reaction- Usually exponential. What does that mean? It continues, but it gets bigger with every time. 
Ex- Extreme dominos multiplying, getting bigger with every step. Or a nuclear chain reaction. 
•	Nuclear reaction are dangerous because it can get big very quickly. One atom splits, and products hits other atoms and gets big fast. 
•	PCR allows us to selectively amplify/copy specific DNA sequences. It’s one of the most powerful/common techniques used. 
•	DNA is always copying into duplicates. 
•	Sequence requires a highly concentrated sample of DNA.  
•	DNA- Deoxyribonucleic acid. 
•	Genomic DNA- any piece of DNA. 
•	But could be specific DNA. 
•	Key concept: IN DNA, (made up of base pairs), only certain regions have known functions. 
•	On a genome, there is DNA. The ret of the stuff is called intergenic regions. 
•	Gene- a segment of DNA that encodes protein. 
•	Non gene- not highly conserved. 
•	A piece of DNA that codes for protein’s is a gene. 
Ex-cxththeredcatthxygmzxlyzn
•	All we see in the DNA are the words, the relevant parts. 
•	There is a difference between genes and non genes. 
•	Genes are highly conversed. 
•	Non genes not conserved. (Not essential to how cells function). 
Thought Question: DNA barcoding lab is to identify species. If we want to ask if species are related, what do we look at? Genes or non genes?
We want to look at genes. Assuming it’s well conserved, with only a few differences. Need to look at a pieces of DNA all species have, so you can make a comparison.
#Notes from DNA Barcoding Lab
•	Cat number- tells us what kit we are using, so if we want to reproduce the experiment, it makes it clear which kit. 
•	Lot number- Which batch the chemicals are made in. If something in the experiment stops working , we can isolate the problem.
•	You grind the plant tissue in a labeled 1.5 ml microfuge tube. 
•	You label on the top, so it is clear who’s tube it is when in the centrifuge. 
•	If you add all 600 μ at once, then the leaf may float and be harder to grind. 
•	Nuclei lysis buffer- Breaks down the cell membrane. 
•	We grind the tissue to help break down the cell wall/cell membrane. 
•	We heat in order to speed u p the process. 
•	RNAse will selectively break down RNA, into individual bases. 
•	Metabolic enzymes will bring stuff together, catabolic will separate stuff. 
•	What is protein precipitation? It pulls protein out of a solution 
•	Triple Point- temperature where all three states of a substance can coexist. 
•	Water is the universal solvent. 
•	Liquid in post centrifuged tube is called supernatant. 
•	Solid is called pellet.

### Interesting News Articles

Place a link to an interesting science or news article where PCR was involved to solve a mystery or to do an experiment. 

>Hint: You can add a link to the notes by putting a set of square brackets '[]' next to a set of parentheses (). Put the text of the link in the square brackets [Text] and the website address in the parentheses (someurl). So '\[Text](someurl)'. When your change is saved  to GitHub it will create the link. You can also see examples in the notes earlier.
