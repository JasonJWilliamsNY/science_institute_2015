# Review Sheet for Quiz II - DNA Barcoding and PCR

## Vocabulary terms may include:
* DNA Barcoding
* DNA Barcoding region (locus)
* PCR
* Primer
* DNA Polymerase
* Taq Polymerase

### Contributions from your notes
PCR is used to  amplify a DNA target sequence. The PCR primers are short pieces of DNA that will get the reaction started. You have to atleast put in the 4 base pairs to get an answer. The probability ot A in a sequence of 1 billion base pairs is 1/4 and the probability of A being next to a T is 1/16... it's all exponential. In order to use PCR, you have to know how the target starts and ends and then you can decide what primers to use. DNA polymerase(enzyme) makes more copies of DNA by filling in the complementary strand. PCR has three stages using DNA polymerase. Stage one is the melting point at about 95 celcius. During this stage, a double strand of DNA becomes a single strand of DNA. Next is the annealing stage at about 50 celcius. During this stage, the reaction is cooled down just enough for the primers to bind. The last stage is the extention stage. During this stage, the bonds formed by the primers are now short double stranded DNA. 

## Concepts and questions that should be tested include:

* Resolution - How do gene/non-gene regions of DNA help us resolve between species and non-species

* How does PCR work (reagents/steps/etc.)?

* How does DNA extraction work(reagents/steps/etc.)?

## Suggested Quiz Questions (class contributed)
1. Why is the isopropanol replaced by ethanol?
2. Why is there a higher advantage of getting the exact targetted space by repeating the extension step more than once?
3. How much resolution is needed to compare a monarch and viceroy butterfly? Explain.
