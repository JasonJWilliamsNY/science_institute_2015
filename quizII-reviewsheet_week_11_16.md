# Review Sheet for Quiz II - DNA Barcoding and PCR

## Vocabulary terms may include:
* DNA Barcoding- a taxonomic method that uses a short genetic marker in an organism's DNA to identify it as belonging to a particular species.
* DNA Barcoding region (locus)- the specific location or position of a gene, DNA sequence, on a chromosome.
* PCR- Polymerase Chain Reaction
* Primer- Oligo, a strand of short nucleic acid sequences (generally about 10 base pairs) that serves as a starting point for DNA synthesis. It is required for DNA replication because the enzymes that catalyze this process, DNA polymerases, can only add new nucleotides to an existing strand of DNA.
* DNA Polymerase- Enzymes that create DNA molecules by assembling nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA.
* Taq Polymerase- thermostable DNA polymerase, used in PCR. 
* Supernatant- The liquid lying above a solid residue after crystallization, precipitation, centrifugation, or other process.


### Contributions from your notes
PCR is used to  amplify a DNA target sequence. The PCR primers are short pieces of DNA that will get the reaction started. You have to atleast put in the 4 base pairs to get an answer. The probability ot A in a sequence of 1 billion base pairs is 1/4 and the probability of A being next to a T is 1/16... it's all exponential. In order to use PCR, you have to know how the target starts and ends and then you can decide what primers to use. DNA polymerase(enzyme) makes more copies of DNA by filling in the complementary strand. PCR has three stages using DNA polymerase. Stage one is the melting point at about 95 celcius. During this stage, a double strand of DNA becomes a single strand of DNA. Next is the annealing stage at about 50 celcius. During this stage, the reaction is cooled down just enough for the primers to bind. The last stage is the extention stage. During this stage, the bonds formed by the primers are now short double stranded DNA. 

## Concepts and questions that should be tested include:

* Resolution - How do gene/non-gene regions of DNA help us resolve between species and non-species

* How does PCR work (reagents/steps/etc.)?

* How does DNA extraction work(reagents/steps/etc.)? 
Steps of DNA Extraction:
1.	Grind plant tissue with nuceli lysis buffer
2.	Incubate sample
3.	Add RNAse
4.	Add protein precipitation solution. Mix gently, incubate. 
5.	Centrifuge at max for three minutes. 
6.	Transfer supernattent, 
7.	Add isoproponal 
8.	Put in fridge
9.	Centrifuge at max speed for one minute
10.	Pour off supernatant and add ethanol. 
11.	Centrifuge at max speed for one minute and pipette off ethanol. 
12.	Add rehydration solution.
