# Writing Homework 2

### Due date: 3/14/2016

### Length: 500 words or less

### Topic: What YUHSG students should know about Zika Virus.   
 

This is a monthly short writing assignment. You should attempt to write a scientific news article at a level of understanding. Though the topic is listed, you can come up with a question to answer that is related to the topic. For example:

- Is the average student at risk for Zika?
- What are the myths and facts about Zika?
- What is the state of research on Zika?

Your article should be written to inform, and should be careful to avoid inserting your own opinions. You should attempt to convey accurate science at a level that a 9th grade student who has taken biology could understand. You should also try to include some of our discussion points in class, for example what are some dangerous reasoning errors or sensational journalism. 


**Important:** Before submitting the article, have one other student from the class review and post comments on the Google Doc.
