# Markdown Homework

As you start to add your contributions to the notes, there is an easy way to format these notes -  [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/). 

Markdown is a simplified version of [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), the code that is behind most webpages on the internet. 

One reason we will be using Markdown in class is that it is a simple way to create documents that anyone can access. You may be very use to using word processing programs like Microsoft Word. While these are very nice, they are not free and not everyone has access. Also, when we are doing work on the computer usually using [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) we would not be able to read these Microsoft documents. Markdown is what we generally will call open-source software, again meaning that its open for just about anyone to use. 

To write something in Markdown, all you need to do is write text like you always do, but you will format it using some special symbols. 

##Using an editor    

It helps to have an editor so that you can see what your markdown will look like when it is rendered (final version that people see). Suggestions for free software include:

* [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) [Mac]
* [Markdown Pad](http://markdownpad.com/) [Windows]


## Markdown Basics

See a really good guide at: https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/

### Paragraphs
Regular paragraphs are no different than typing on any text editor/word processor. Just type.

### Adding Headings
Use the '#' key to make a line a heading (subtitle). For really big fonts use just one '#' the more '#'s' used, the smaller the subtitle. 

# Example 1
## Example 2
### Example 3
#### Example 4

### Bolding and emphasis
Surrounding a word or phrase with one set of asterisks (**) *makes it italic*. Using two sets **makes it bold**. 

#### Lists 
Lists can be
* Unordered
* Start with a single asterisk
* Have one item per line.

To make an ordered list:
1. Start the list with one number, followed by a period
2. On the next line, just use the next number. 


#### Links and Images
A link is properly written in markdown using a pair of square brackets '[]' followed by round parentheses '()'. The text of the link will go in the square brackets, and the actual URL will go in the parentheses:

If you want an image, just follow the link text in the brackets with an exclamation mark '![ ]\( )'
