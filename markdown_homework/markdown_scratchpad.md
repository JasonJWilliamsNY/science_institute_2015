###*Background Information*
* In the cell, there is **DNA**. There are **genes** and **non-genes**. 
* We want to focus on the **target sequence**, we want to amplify it and know more about it and copy it. 
**PCR Primer**- short pieces of DNA called *oligios*
* It's like a google search bar. 
* You put information into the system in order to retrieve information.
