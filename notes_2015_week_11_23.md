#### Week of : November 23, 2015

### Important terms

* Gel Electrophoresis
* Band migration
* Sanger DNA Sequencing


### Important Concepts
* Gel electrophoresis separates DNA by size
* We use electrophoresis to confirm our PCR worked
* PCR amplified DNA can be sequenced (read) 


## Electrophoresis and sequencing

After we have amplified DNA by PCR we need to examine the results. The conventional way to do this is by using [Gel Electrophoresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis). 

Review this [animation on DNA electrophoresis](https://www.dnalc.org/resources/animations/gelelectrophoresis.html)

### Questions to answer about electrophoresis

1. What type of gel is used?
2. What is the loading dye and what is the purpose?
3. How does DNA migrate in an electric field?
4. How do we view the stained DNA bands; what stain, what light source is used?
