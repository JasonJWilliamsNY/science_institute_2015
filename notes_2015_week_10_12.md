## Understanding Safety in the lab

One of the most important responsibilities in the lab is to conduct experiments safely. We owe it to ourselves and our colleagues to be sure that our experiments are conducted in a way that does not engager health. Importantly **for our course** we will not be working with chemicals, materials, or techniques that pose any significant threats. Nevertheless, **'sola dosis facit venenum'**. We may at times work with open flames and sharp objects. It is important that every student **make themselves familiar** with possible safety risks and hazards. You may one day work in a laboratory (especially when doing independent research) where there are chemicals or instruments that do pose risks [Even at school there are items in our storage that may be dangerous if mishandled]. You must take responsibility, because you may not always be informed by others. To help us know how to understand these dangers we will consider the MSDS and Fire Diamond. 


## Working with chemicals in the molecular laboratory

A basic understanding of chemistry is needed to work in the molecular biology laboratory. We need to understand how to work with the major solutions of our laboratory including buffers, gels, and other reagents. Most of our solutions are used at standard concentrations reported in Molarity (M). We often keep reagents as stock solutions, with are diluted to  aliquots of working solutions. Understanding moles, concentration, and dilution - including the lab math needed to calculate recipes is a basic skill for working in the lab. We also need to know the tools we use to measure these solutions and how and when our measurement errors can be identified and compensated for.
