#DNA Barcoding
#### Week of : February 29, 2016


### Important Concepts
* The restriction enzyme experiment has a simple design and allows us to examine simple positive and negative controls. 
* Through staining, we can also examine the sensitivity of our experiment (how much DNA we can detect)
* We will be examining our controls qualitatively, additional experiments will also allow us to make some quantitative observations. 


## Electrophoresis and sequencing

Review this information on [Gel Electrophoresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis).

## Protocol 1% Agarose TBE Gel

Building on our previous experiment notes we will make a 1% w/v agarose gel in TBE buffer. 

1. From 10X TBE buffer, make 100ml of 1X TBE
2. To 100ml of TBE add 1000mg of agarose (final con. 1% w/v)
3. Using a microwave, carefully make the gel. Be sure to minimize any boiling to avoid altering the concentration of the TBE. 
4. Pour the gel and allow to set. Store gel in 1X TBE for use.
